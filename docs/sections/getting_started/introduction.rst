The PhysioZoo platform is an open source project dedicated to the study of the heart rate variability (HRV) in mammals’ electrophysiological recordings. The platform includes: an open source software (code and user interface) for the analysis of the HRV in mammals and a set of annotated databases of electrophysiological signals (raw electrocardiogram and beating rate time series) from dog, rabbit and mouse.
The software includes all the standard HRV measures which have been adapted for their use with different mammals (human, rabbit, dog, mouse). All HRV measures can be easily adapted for the analysis of other mammals.
All computed measures can be easily exported together with standard high quality data representation figures. This ease post-processing and analysis of the HRV measures generated with statistics software such as MATLAB or R.
The PhysioZoo mission is to standardize and enable the reproducibility of HRV analysis in mammals’ electrophysiological data. This is achieved through its open source code, freely available software and open access databases. It also aims to encourage the scientific community to contribute their electrophysiological databases and novel HRV algorithms/analysis tools for advancing the research in the field.
